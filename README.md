# Armenian-Chess-Rating-Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains data analysis and visualization work focused on the ratings of Armenian chess players. It explores correlations and trends in both international (FIDE) and national (Armenian Chess Federation) ratings. The analysis also considers demographic factors, including age, gender, and even zodiac signs, as well as the impact of Armenia’s national educational policies on chess training.

## Background

Armenia has a deeply rooted chess culture. Its national team has been recognized internationally, winning the Chess Olympiad multiple times. The sport’s importance is further reflected in the Armenian education system, where chess has been a compulsory subject in schools since 2011. Historically, Armenian chess players have faced economic barriers to participating in international tournaments. Consequently, while their national ratings often climb due to frequent local competition, their international ratings can lag behind, failing to accurately represent their true playing strength.

## Objectives

1. **Rating Distribution:** Visualize and analyze rating distributions among Armenian chess players at both national and international levels.
2. **Demographic Analysis:** Investigate how variables such as age, gender, and zodiac signs relate to rating performance.
3. **Zodiac Hypothesis:** Examine the claim that individuals born under the Virgo sign excel in chess, inspired by notable Virgo-born players (e.g., Garry Kasparov).
4. **Educational Impact:** Assess whether mandatory chess education in Armenian schools correlates with an increased number of players and improved rating trends.
5. **Dual-Rating System Insight:** Evaluate the implications of maintaining separate national and international ratings, especially given socioeconomic constraints that limit Armenian players’ global exposure.

## Data Sources

- **FIDE Ratings Data:** International player ratings sourced from official FIDE lists.
- **Armenian Chess Federation Data:** National player ratings sourced from local federation records.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean, merge, and preprocess national and international rating datasets.
2. **Visualization Techniques:** Employ histograms, density plots, and map plots to identify and highlight trends and patterns.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Apply correlation analyses and comparisons across different demographic groups and zodiac signs.
4. **Policy Evaluation:** Examine rating evolution over time to discern the effects of making chess compulsory in schools and to understand the ramifications of maintaining dual-rating systems.

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

- **Rating Trends:** Evidence of differing progression in national versus international rating trajectories.
- **Zodiac Correlation:** Early insights suggest that Virgos may exhibit higher performance, aligning with the stated hypothesis.
- **Educational Influence:** Introduction of chess in schools appears to correlate with both increased participation and possibly improved average skill levels.
- **Dual-Rating System Impact:** Maintaining separate national and international ratings may underrepresent the true strength of Armenian players on the global stage.

## Future Work

- **Enhanced Analysis:** Integrate more advanced statistical and machine learning models to deepen insights.
- **Longitudinal Studies:** Extend temporal analysis to validate whether observed trends persist over longer periods.
- **Comparative Benchmarking:** Compare Armenian players’ performance data against other chess-heavy nations to contextualize findings.
